Mostly just an introduction to the course. Looking forward to more exposure to all the resources within AWS for training and deploying machine learning models.

SageMaker SDK 2.x is not backward compatible with 1.x
SageMaker SDK 2.0 is not backward compatible with 1.0

For some brilliant reason, the SageMaker SDK team has made code-breaking changes in 2.0, and it is no longer backward compatible with the 1.x version of SDK.

The code example in this course that uses SageMaker SDK may not work if you have SageMaker 2.0 SDK in your notebook.

One quick fix is to downgrade the SDK in your machine/notebook to the 1.x version.

I have provided instructions in the below thread. Please use this thread to report issues and provide your feedback.

I am planning to update all examples to 2.x, and I will keep you posted. Thank you for your understanding.
